INSTRUCTIONS

Since the thermometer can be used multiple times on the same page with different data, each should have it's own set of data storage and functions to use. Create a thermometer JavaScript object that stores the name, goal, and amount raised and has methods that can individually do the following: update the amount raised and progress bar, perform a mock AJAX call to get new data, and handle load/init type of functionality.

Add some interactivity to the widget. At a minimum, clicking the "Give Now!" button should produce some type of success message within the widget. Feel free to add any other interactions that you think would make for a pleasant giving experience for the end user.

No restrictions on style or presentation, and feel free to use jQuery to your heart's desire.
