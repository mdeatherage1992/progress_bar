INSTRUCTIONS

Recreate the linked image in HTML and CSS adding your own interactions. Some things to keep in mind when coding:

- The "widget" may be used multiple times on the page
- The logo image can be uploaded by the client so sizes may vary - we should do our best to maintain a uniform look across all instances of the widgets
- Same thing applies to the name of the organization, the length may vary
- It's themeable, the purple color is part of the theme and should be easy to change
